nsqd-client-finder
------------------

`nsqd-client-finder` is a small utility for finding all clients connected in a nsq ecosystem and mapping the authenticated usernames to the host (or k8s pod) they originate from.  This provides a mapping of:

```
{
    "platform_service_token_from_vault_2022": [
        "prod-data-ingest-useast1a-02",
        "k8s-pod-sage-engine",
        <etc>
    ],
    "platform_service_token_from_vault_2021": [
        "k8s-pod-instagram-attribution",
        "k8s-pod-fb-pm-attachment-storage",
        "prod-inbox-bus-useast1a-02",
        <etc>
    ]
}
```
